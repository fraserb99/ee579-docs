They send inputs to the API and receive messages to perform outputs. Adding Devices # Before devices can be used to create rules, they must be claimed by a tenant. The first step is to power the device on. When powered on for the first time, the device will register itself with the system, making it possible to claim it in the web interface. After the device has been powered on, navigatet to the devices page and click the add button above the table. This shows the modal below. This shows the devices available for you to claim. You must be on the same network as a device in order to claim it. This prevents other users from claiming devices that do not belong to them. The devices are listed by their MAC address which you may use to identify specific devices when multiple are available. If you do not know the MAC address of your device you can press the lightbulb button. This will flash an LED on the device for 5 seconds, allwoing you to identify which device the list item corresponds to. To claim a device press the add button next to its MAC address. This will bring up a form allowing you to give the device a user friendly name before claiming it. Managing Existing Devices # After devices have been added, they will be visible on the devices page as shown below. This page allows you to view all of your devices and their current state. The 'Connection State' column shows whether the device is currently connected to the MQTT broker and able to send and receive inputs and outputs. It also allows you to preform some actions on the device. Here you may identify a device in the same way as when claiming it, by pressing the LED button. You can also change the device's name and unclaim it from the current tenant. Unclaiming a Device # You may wish to unclaim a device from a tenant. This removes the device from its current tenant, and removes it from any rules it may have been involved in. This does not delete the device completely, only resets it, allowing it to be claimed by another tenant. If you want to move a device from one tenant to another this would be the way of doing that. Device Groups # Device groups provide a method of grouping devices with similar functions to improve the process of adding and managing rules.

Trigger # The Rule trigger is the device input that will trigger the rule and cause the outputs to be performed. This is composed of the input type and parameters desired, and the device or device group the input will come from. If a device group is chosen, an input matching the desired type and parameters from any of the groups devices will trigger the rule. There are several input types that can be chosen: Input Types # Button Pushed # This input is sent when the button is pushed on a device. The duration desired to trigger the rule can be set to one of three values: Short Press - 0s < 2s Medium Press - 2s < 10s Long Press - > 10s Switch Flipped # This input allows rules to be triggered when one of the 2 switches on the device are flipped. The peripheral (switch 1 or 2) can be chosen and the switch state. The switch state is used to specify whether the switch should be triggered when the switch is flipped to an on or off state. Potentiometer # This input allows you to specify a range of potentiometer values that will trigger the rule. The default configuration is a range between two values but this can also be inverted to allow for specifying a range of values less than the lower value or greater than the higher value. This can be done by pressing the button between the values, or manually setting the greater than value to be higher than the less than. When using a potentiometer value as an input it should be noted that the rule will not be triggered every time the potentiometer value changes if it is within the trigger range. Instead, the system keeps track of the last potentiometer value sent by the device and only triggers the rule if the last value was outwith the range and the new value is within it. Temperature # This input allows you to use the temperature sensor on your device as a trigger for the rule. It functions in a similar way to the potentiometer trigger, with a range picker. Again this range can be inverted, and the rule is only triggered when the last value did not satisfy the conditions. Outputs # These are the outputs that will be performed when a rule is triggered. Multiple outputs can be performed for each rule. Output Types # Buzzer - On # This output is used to sound a continuous buzzer tone for the specified duration. Buzzer - Beep # This output beeps the buzzer with the duty cycle specified. The minimum values for the on and off duration are 200ms. LED - Output # This output can be used to turn an LED on or off. There are 3 LEDs that can be selected, corresponding to the LEDs on the MSP430G2553. As such, LEDs 1 and 2 are single colour, but a colour - Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, White - can be chosen when LED 3 is selected.
